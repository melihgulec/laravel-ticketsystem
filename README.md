# Laravel Ticket System

This is a help desk application that I developed using Laravel Framework. It allows companies to manage help requests submitted by users for their respective products.

## Content of the Application
- The application consists of three roles: user, staff, and administrator.
- Users submit their help requests to staff by entering the product, problem category, title, and description.
- Staff can update the priority of the help request (critical, high, medium, and low).
- Staff can change the status of the help request (open, answered, and closed).
- Both staff and users can add comments to the help request.
- As an administrator, new users, staff, products, product categories, and problem categories can be added.

## Technologies Used

### AlpineJS
AlpineJS has been used to add JavaScript events to HTML tags.

### MYSQL
All database operations in the application were performed using MYSQL.

## Packages Used

### [Laravel-Table](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table])
It was used for listing screens in the application. Users can perform operations such as searching, reordering, viewing, deleting, and editing quickly on these pages.
